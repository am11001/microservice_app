## Project Description: Flask Microservice for Video to MP3 Conversion

**Overview:**
The Flask microservice application is designed to facilitate the conversion of video files to MP3 format. Leveraging RabbitMQ for message queuing, Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestration, and Docker for containerization, the application ensures efficient, scalable, and reliable video processing. Key components include an authentication system, a converter module for video to MP3 conversion, RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication, notification management, and a gateway for external interactions.

**Components:**

1. **Authentication Service:**
   - Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - Secures access to the video conversion service.

2. **Converter Module:**
   - Converts video files received into MP3 format.
   - Utilizes FFmpeg or similar libraries for conversion.
   - Ensures quality conversion with minimal loss.

3. **RabbitMQ Integration:**
   - Facilitates asynchronous communication between components.
   - Queues incoming video conversion requests.
   - Ensures scalability and reliability of message delivery.

4. **Notifications Management:**
   - Sends notifications to users upon completion of video conversion.
   - Provides status updates throughout the conversion process.
   - Supports various notification channels (e.g., email, SMS).

5. **Gateway:**
   - Acts as an entry point for external interactions.
   - Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
   - Enforces security policies and rate limiting.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Flask:** Provides the foundation for building the microservice application with Python.
- **RabbitMQ:** Serves as the messaging broker for asynchronous communication.
- **Kubernetes (K8s):** Orchestrates containerized microservices, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Docker:** Containerization platform for packaging the application and its dependencies.
- **FFmpeg:** Library for handling multimedia data, used for video to MP3 conversion.
- **Auth0 or similar:** Provides authentication and authorization services.
- **Flask JWT:** Integration for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication in Flask applications.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users authenticate through the authentication service.
   - Upon successful authentication, they receive a JWT token for accessing the conversion service.

2. **Video Conversion Request:**
   - Users submit video files to the microservice via the gateway.
   - The gateway verifies the JWT token before forwarding the request to the converter module.

3. **Conversion Process:**
   - The converter module receives the video conversion request.
   - It queues the request in RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing.
   - Worker nodes pick up conversion tasks from the queue, process them using FFmpeg, and generate MP3 files.

4. **Notification and Status Updates:**
   - Throughout the conversion process, notifications are sent to the user via the notification management system.
   - Users receive notifications upon request submission, completion, or any errors encountered during the conversion process.

5. **Scalability and Reliability:**
   - Kubernetes ensures scalability by dynamically scaling up or down based on the workload.
   - Docker containers provide a consistent runtime environment, enhancing reliability and portability.

**Conclusion:**
The Flask microservice application, integrated with RabbitMQ for message queuing, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Docker for containerization, offers a robust solution for video to MP3 conversion. With authentication, asynchronous processing, notifications, and scalability features, the application provides a seamless experience for users seeking efficient multimedia conversion.
